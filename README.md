 - Each spreadsheet (multiple sheets) will act as a business module providing users data manipulation functioanlity
 - Spreadsheets can have own REST API making them act as micro services
 - External systems such as mobile, web front ends can be built on top of the REST APIs
 
Rapid-gas project provide necessary framework functions to rapidly develop these microservices and allows easy integrations inbetween. Also it introduces conventions that can make the spreadsheets to look more like datatables with business schemas.
